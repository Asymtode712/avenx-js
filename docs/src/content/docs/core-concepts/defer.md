title: Deferred Loading (<@defer>)
description: Declarative deferred loading of components and DOM subtrees until a defined trigger fires.
---

The `<@defer>` compiler tag enables **declarative deferred loading** of components and DOM subtrees in Avenx.js. Content is not rendered immediately; instead, it is loaded only when the configured trigger is fired.

This can help reduce the initial rendering and JavaScript workload by processing non-critical content only when needed.

---

## Basic Syntax

To defer a section of your template, simply wrap it with the `<@defer>` tag:

```html
<@defer>
  <HeavyChart data="{{ state.chartData }}" />
</@defer>
```

When no `when` attribute is specified, `<@defer>` defaults to the `idle` trigger. It uses `requestIdleCallback` when available in the browser, falling back to a short timer otherwise.

---

## Trigger Modes (`when="..."`)

The `when` attribute defines when the deferred content should be loaded:

| Trigger              | Syntax                              | Description                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`idle`** (Default) | `<@defer when="idle">`              | Loads content during browser idle time.                                                   |
| **`visible`**        | `<@defer when="visible">`           | Loads content as soon as the defer container becomes visible in the viewport.             |
| **`interaction`**    | `<@defer when="interaction">`       | Loads content upon user interaction. Currently, `click` or `mouseenter` triggers loading. |
| **`timer(ms)`**      | `<@defer when="timer(1000)">`       | Loads content after the specified delay in milliseconds.                                  |
| **Expression**       | `<@defer when="state.showDetails">` | Evaluates the specified expression and loads content when the result is truthy.           |

### `idle`

The `idle` trigger loads deferred content as soon as the browser has idle time available.

```html
<@defer when="idle">
  <HeavyChart />
</@defer>
```

Avenx.js uses `requestIdleCallback` when this browser API is available, falling back to a short timer otherwise.

### `visible`

The `visible` trigger loads content as soon as the defer container becomes visible in the viewport.

```html
<@defer when="visible">
  <HeavyChart />
</@defer>
```

Avenx.js uses an `IntersectionObserver` for this. Once the container becomes visible, the observer is disconnected and the deferred content is loaded.

### `interaction`

The `interaction` trigger loads content as soon as the user interacts with the defer container.

Currently, both `click` and `mouseenter` trigger loading of the content. The trigger values `click` and `hover` are also supported as interaction triggers.

```html
<@defer when="click">
  <HeavyChart />
</@defer>

<@defer when="hover">
  <HeavyChart />
</@defer>
```

### `timer`

The `timer` trigger loads deferred content after the specified delay in milliseconds elapses.

```html
<@defer when="timer(2000)">
  <BannerAd />
</@defer>
```

In this example, the content is loaded after 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds). Avenx.js also supports time values in the `1000ms` format.

### Expression

An expression can be used as a trigger in the `when="<expression>"` form to load deferred content based on the current state.

```html
<@defer when="state.isReady">
  <HeavyComponent />
</@defer>
```

The expression is evaluated when the defer container is processed. If the result is truthy, the deferred content is loaded. If the container is processed again later, the expression is re-evaluated.

## Placeholders & Loading States (`<@placeholder>` & `<@loading>`)

Optional sub-tags can be used within `<@defer>`.

### `<@placeholder>`

`<@placeholder>` defines the content displayed while waiting for the configured trigger.

```html
<@defer when="visible">
  <@placeholder>
    <div class="skeleton-loader">
      Diagramm wird geladen, sobald es sichtbar ist...
    </div>
  </@placeholder>

  <HeavyChart data="{{ state.chartData }}" />
</@defer>
```

### `<@loading>`

`<@loading>` is recognized by the compiler and prepared as a separate loading template.

```html
<@defer when="visible">
  <@loading>
    <div class="spinner">Profil wird geladen...</div>
  </@loading>

  <UserProfileDetails user="{{ state.user }}" />
</@defer>
```

**Current status:** In the current synchronous runtime, the `<@loading>` template is not yet displayed. Once the trigger is fired, the deferred content is rendered directly. Active display of the loading state can be added with future asynchronous loading support.

---

## Multiple Triggers

Combining multiple triggers is not currently supported.

For example, the following syntax cannot be used at this time:

```html
<@defer when="visible; interaction">
  <HeavyComponent />
</@defer>
```

Currently, only one trigger can be specified for a `<@defer>` block. Support for combining multiple triggers is planned for a future update.

## Cleanup and Lifecycle

Avenx.js registers corresponding cleanup functions for active triggers.

Depending on the trigger used, these include:

- Removing event listeners for `click` and `mouseenter`.
- Canceling timers with `clearTimeout()`.
- Canceling idle callbacks with `cancelIdleCallback()`, when available.
- Disconnecting `IntersectionObserver` instances with `disconnect()`.

When the trigger is fired and the deferred content is loaded, the associated trigger cleanup function is executed.

> [!NOTE]
> Complete cleanup on unmount of a parent component is not currently guaranteed. The `DeferManager.destroy()` method is currently a placeholder and is not yet called during component teardown. Full unmount cleanup is planned for a future update.

## How it works

Processing of `<@defer>` takes place in two primary steps:

1. **Compilation step:** The compiler recognizes `<@defer>` and lowers it into a **render program** (or converts it into a special defer container when falling back to the **string renderer** via `ComponentParser`). Depending on the content used, templates for `<@placeholder>`, `<@loading>`, and the deferred content itself can be stored within it.

2. **Runtime step:** The `DeferManager` processes the defer containers and sets up the configured trigger. Depending on the trigger, it uses `requestIdleCallback`, `IntersectionObserver`, event listeners, or `setTimeout`.

Once the trigger is fired, the `DeferManager` renders the deferred content and removes previously rendered placeholder content.
